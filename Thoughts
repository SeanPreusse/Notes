Getting HR insights from your team

Your team will require a few different skills to start generating insights. You may be able to get most of them by having an experienced HR business partner team up with someone who can source and analyse data. This may be a great strategy to start as you can quickly identify what is important, build a business case for additional resourcing either time or technology. 

At some point you may reach a bottle neck where you have squeezed the sponge dry and it may be difficult to find new insights or more commonly, your analyst and team get stuck into monthly dashboards or ad hoc lists that may not add the right value to finding real business insights.

Here are my top 10 tips to building a best in class analytics function that that will with time start to add value and insight to the top levels of the organisation.

1. Stop the dashboards with typical HR metrics. Time and time again I see dashboards or monthly reports being sent with measures like attrition rates by line of business or recruitment metrics like time to fill. The former will usually not have enough detail to identify if it is good or bad or more importantly hide key information about the type of turnover creating future organisation issues. The latter focuses on the recruitment teams efficiency That could have a negative impact to the quality of the hire impacting new starter retention and potentially lowering productivity Impacting revenue or creating higher risk / lowering brand reputation.

There is HR reporting and HR insights to action. You should have the reporting aspect automated and centralised to ensure standard definitions and understanding, within this you should know who your customers are and measure demand. On the other side, an insight is usually temporary and available for a finite period of time either until the organisations misses many opportunities and gets taken over or they do not survive. The best way to start creating insights is by working on specific business problems through sprint programs lasting between 4-6 weeks. These should be sponsored by an executive and involve a technical lead, engagement manager and someone from the business.

2. Start talking with the business to identify top organisational priorities and risks. Key priorities could be raising revenue, decreasing operational cost, retention of top talent and building key future capabilities with new products or operating model. These priorities then need to be broken down further I.e. How much of this can be controlled internally? What proportion of this relates to workforce? With this information, you can then start to understand key segments and where this relates to in he employment life cycle.

If you would like to start thinking about key HR metrics in a different way then I suggest that you take a look at this metric dictionary by Visie.

3. Behavioural based analysis. This may sound difficult to do but it can be very easy. This is about segmenting key workforce metrics against segments that best identify groups of employees. The data that you have available should include information on the types of positions, this needs to be taken up a level to identify role and talent segments. Supply and demand for particular roles have varied widely in the past 10 years, we have seen a higher demand for engineers and now a higher demand for technology professionals. Grouping by role where statistically significant can help to shed light on retention, productivity and leadership issues and help to develop strategy to improve.
