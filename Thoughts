Talent acceleration

Research suggests that top performing employees add an additional 3x ROI when compared to other employees. This gap does require further investigation, firstly why is the gap so high and why was our last engagement results so low?

Getting the best out of your employees and ensuring high engagement has been a key challenge for most organisations. Insert research here.

What is your organisation doing to measure these things?

Research suggests that this can be improved, cording to x, the percentage of employees who have an active career / development plan is very low and what businesses can do about to address the issue can not only be easy but commercially beneficial.

Start with the career plan, what are the typical career path aspirations of employees? You can look at existing data of historical promotions and lateral moves to understand how employees have historically moved throughout the organisations and also understand where potential blockages may exist. To make greater sense of this more mature organisations use a job family framework coupled with a capability matrix, through this you can understand how employees have transitioned into key roles through the development and mastery is specific skills and behaviours. You can also make an easy start by grouping positions into roles like Analyst, Senior analyst and Technical lead with an overlay of 10% salary increase not driven by changes in market or role transition.

With this analysis what are the best career pathways and what managers are great at accelerating talent? The latter is an interesting one and can be measured in a few different ways, try looking at the number of promotions a manager has given and average this out by the size of the team and the tenure as a manager, some of the results should resonate well and some areas may have a few surprises

First look at the population - what percentage of the workforce has been identified as a high performer, even without the bell curve managers should know who their top performing staff are.  

Many organisations do not have the capability to look deeply into what takes top talent within an organisation and importantly why they should care. Firstly you need to take it one step at a time, here are some tips to help you get started.

First define what makes to talent and how much value they add to the organisation, this can be quantified by project success rates multiplied by ROI and overall productivity when compared to their peers.

Social aspects are also important - are they an important influencer, can they connect people internal and externally to get things done? If so they be a great resource to utilise.

Next, identify the population group. The definition needs to be more than those that are on the executive succession plan and those who are rated as a 4/5 performance rating. It should be based on potential all roles across the organisation.

. The removal of the bell curve may appear to throw a spanner in the works however many managers should already have an idea of who their top talent and this information should already be captured as apart in development and career plans. 

This population may consist of individuals w

The baseline is constantly moving but what is a healthy proportion of identified top talent to the organisation.

Identifying and retaining top talent is not difficult however attrition rates for this group of employees in most organisations is usually very high. 

How can we intervene earlyf to stop a potential regretted loss to the organisation? 
Are we developing top talent for other organisations?
